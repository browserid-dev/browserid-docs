# Enhancing Security and Reducing Costs in Digital Authentication

In the digital landscape, companies are seeking solutions to enhance security and user experience while managing costs. BrowserID uses cryptographic keypair technology to securely identify and trust a user's browser without cookies or device fingerprinting.

A significant cost benefit of BrowserID is reducing reliance on SMS one-time passwords (OTPs).

BrowserID supports compliance with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) standards. SCA is a requirement under PSD2 for enhancing payment security. Implementing SCA can have associated costs, such as potential customer drop-off due to added friction.

Fraud prevention is another area where BrowserID can provide cost benefits.

By reducing the need for SMS OTPs and enhancing security, BrowserID can potentially help companies save on authentication costs and mitigate fraud risks. However, specific cost savings would depend on individual company circumstances and implementation details.
