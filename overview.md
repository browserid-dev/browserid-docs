# Overview

With rapidly evolving threats from autonomous AIs agents such as ChatGPT Operator to enhanced phishing attacks, companies must evolve security practices to ensure that who they think is who they are.

BrowserID securely and silently enhances authentication, without relying on cookies or device fingerprinting. Using cryptographic keypair technology, BrowserID silently "trusts" your user's browser, without relying on cookies or [device fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint).

It also supports compliance with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_customer_authentication) (SCA) and [Secure Payment Confirmation](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-payment-confirmation/) (SPC) standards.

When combined with other authentication methods, such as 2FA or biometrics, BrowserID provides a secure, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly experience. This approach effectively combats sophisticated fraud threats while maintaining a seamless user journey.
