# Overview

With one click, your client's browser become their secure, private passports to your digital services. That's BrowserID.

Using cryptographic keypair technology, BrowserID securely and silently "trusts" a client's browser, without relying on cookies or [device fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint).

By facilitating trusted devices, BrowserID allows for frictionless logins and reduces the reliance on traditional, less secure authentication methods like passwords and one-time PINs, which are susceptible to fraud. It also supports compliance with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_customer_authentication) (SCA) and [Secure Payment Confirmation](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-payment-confirmation/) (SPC) standards.

When combined with other authentication methods, such as 2FA or biometrics, BrowserID provides a secure, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly experience. This approach effectively combats sophisticated fraud threats while maintaining a seamless user journey.
