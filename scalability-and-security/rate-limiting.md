# Rate Limiting

The goal of rate limiting is to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources. By controlling the number of requests a user or system can make to an API, we maintain optimal performance and security.

Our API employs a rate limiting strategy to balance accessibility with protection against misuse. Below are the specifics of our rate limiting policy:

## Rate Limit:

- `api.browserid.dev/*`: 1000 requests per second, per workspace

For higher limits, please contact us at [sales@browserid.dev](mailto:sales@browserid.dev).
