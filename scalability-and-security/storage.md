# Storage

BrowserID uses a combination of secure browser and server-side storage, which allows us to offer a seamless user experience while also providing a high degree of anonymity and security.

## Browser Storage

The private key, userID and deviceID are securely stored in the browser's [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) indefinitely\* or until the user deletes it.

IndexedDB follows the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), similar to how secure cookies work, so the private key and nounce are only accessible by the same hostname.

### Private Key

When a user's device generates a key pair, the private key is stored in the user's browser's IndexedDB and never leaves the user's browser.

### User ID

The user ID is a value that is provided by the user or your service and is stored in the user's browser's IndexedDB.

### Device ID

The device ID is a value that is generated by the browser and is stored in the user's browser's IndexedDB.

## Server Storage

### Public Key

The user's public key is stored within the [user's instance of BrowserID](./scalability) and only accessible by using a combination of a nounce and user ID and a few additional checks.

### What is the same-origin policy?

A security mechanism that limits how documents and scripts from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

### What is an origin?

An origin is defined by the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port.

### How does the same-origin policy work with IndexedDB?

Each origin has it's own set of databases, and each database has a unique name within it's origin. For example, an app on https://example.com/app/ can access databases named `app` and `app2` but not `https://another-example.com/app/` databases.

The same-origin policy helps to:

- Isolate data between different origins
- Prevent malicious websites from reading sensitive data from other websites
